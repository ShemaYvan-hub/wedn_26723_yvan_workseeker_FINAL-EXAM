## üß¨ Project Title: WORK SEEKER PLATFORM ‚Äì FIND YOUR DREAM JOB  

---

## üåÄ Phase I ‚Äì Introduction

In Rwanda and many developing countries, young graduates and job seekers face significant barriers to employment due to a mismatch between their skills and job market needs. Additionally, employers struggle to find properly trained candidates who meet the evolving standards of the labor market. 

The Work Seeker Platform is a PL/SQL-driven database system designed to support unemployed individuals by facilitating structured access to career guidance, training programs, and employer job listings. This system aims to automate the job search and training enrollment process, improving the efficiency of job matching between job seekers and organizations in need of qualified personnel.

By centralizing job seeker data, training records, and employer job posts, the platform reduces the burden of manual tracking and enhances data security, access, and decision-making.

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

Many Rwandan youth face unemployment due to lack of job-ready skills, inefficient job-matching systems, and limited exposure to real job opportunities. Traditional employment centers lack automation and cannot effectively match candidates based on qualifications and career interests.

At the same time, companies and organizations spend unnecessary time and resources reviewing unqualified candidates because there's no structured database connecting them to the right talent pool. The absence of such a platform creates inefficiencies on both the supply and demand side of the labor market.

---

## üëÅÔ∏è Context

The Work Seeker Platform is designed for deployment in:
- üè¢ Employment agencies
- üéì Training institutions
- üè≠ Private sector companies
- üèõÔ∏è Government job support initiatives
- ü§ù NGO-driven employment and empowerment programs

It will serve as a centralized solution for registering job seekers, assigning them to relevant training, and matching them with job vacancies posted by employers based on their qualifications.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíº Target Users

- üéØ Job Seekers ‚Äì Individuals actively seeking training or employment.
- üéì Training Providers ‚Äì Institutions or NGOs offering short/long-term upskilling programs.
- üè¢ Employers ‚Äì Businesses or organizations with active job vacancies.
- üèõÔ∏è Government and NGOs ‚Äì Partners interested in improving national employment outcomes.

---

## üéØ Project Goals

- **Automate** registration, training, and job application workflows.
- **Improve accuracy** of candidate-job matching using skill-based filters and structured SQL queries.
- **Enhance security** for storing sensitive user and company information.
- **Increase employment** by streamlining the path from training to hiring.
- **Support scalability** for future integration with government portals and job boards.

---

## üß± Database Design (Main Entities)

- **Job_Seeker** (`Seeker_ID`, Name, Contact, Education, Job_Level, Skills)
- **Training_Program** (`Program_ID`, Name, Description, Duration)
- **Enrollment** (`Enrollment_ID`, Seeker_ID, Program_ID, Completion_Status)
- **Employer** (`Employer_ID`, Company_Name, Industry, Contact)
- **Job_Vacancy** (`Job_ID`, Employer_ID, Job_Title, Skills_Required, Status)
- **Job_Application** (`Application_ID`, Seeker_ID, Job_ID, Status)

---

> This system is envisioned to transform the way job seekers and employers interact in Rwanda, serving as a digital bridge between education, skills, and employment.
# üåÄ Phase II ‚Äì Business Process Modeling  
üìö Project Title: Work Seeker Platform ‚Äì Job Matching & Training System

---

## üó∫Ô∏è 1. Define the Scope

### üîÑ Business Process:  
Job Matching and Training Enrollment for Job Seekers

### üìú Description:  
This process models how unemployed individuals register on the platform, complete their profile, enroll in training programs if necessary, and apply for jobs that match their skills. The system suggests relevant opportunities based on their qualifications and automates the job matching workflow.

The platform integrates seamlessly with a Management Information System (MIS) by tracking all interactions, training progress, and job application statuses, providing structured data for decision-making and reporting.

---

### üéØ Objectives:
- Streamline the job search and application process.
- Ensure job seekers gain relevant skills through training programs.
- Automatically match candidates to vacancies using SQL queries based on qualifications and skills.
- Help employers find qualified candidates more efficiently.

---

### üìà Expected Outcomes:
- Faster and more accurate job matching.
- Increased training participation by job seekers.
- Reduced unemployment through smarter recommendations.
- Real-time tracking of applications and training progress for decision support.

---

## üß© 2. Identify Key Entities

| Entity / Actor     | Role & Responsibilities                                                                 |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Job Seeker**     | Registers, completes profile, enrolls in training, applies for jobs.                     |
| **Training Provider** | Offers skill-building programs and tracks completions.                                |
| **Employer**       | Posts job vacancies and hires candidates matched by the system.                          |
| **System Database**| Stores user profiles, training records, job posts, and applications.                    |
| **Government/NGOs**| May support or fund training and employment initiatives.                                 |

---

## üèä Swimlanes to Use

The BPMN diagram is organized into the following lanes:

- **Job Seeker** ‚Äì Registration, training, and job application.
- **Training Provider** ‚Äì Manages program validation and completion.
- **Employer** ‚Äì Posts jobs and reviews applications.
- **System** ‚Äì Matches skills to vacancies and automates workflows.

---

## üñáÔ∏è UML / BPMN Presentation

The visual diagram uses:
- **Ovals** for start/end points
- **Rectangles** for tasks
- **Diamonds** for decision nodes
- **Arrows** to show flow

![1b75e188-0a25-44e3-876e-eee6ea4ffdc9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f779ad5-fd2a-4876-849c-9011fdf25d95)


---

## üí¨ Explanation of the BPMN Diagram

### ‚úçÔ∏è Main Components and Interactions:
The process begins with a **job seeker** registering and completing their profile. If their skills are insufficient, the system recommends training programs. The seeker enrolls, and the training provider tracks progress.

Once completed, the system uses stored SQL logic to match the seeker with relevant job opportunities. The seeker applies, and the **employer** reviews applications. All interactions are stored in the **system database**, which can be analyzed by MIS tools for performance tracking and decision-making.

---

### üß† How This Supports MIS Functions:
- **Improved Decision-Making**: Data on enrollments, applications, and hires feed MIS dashboards.
- **Workflow Automation**: From registration to hiring, everything is logged and traceable.
- **Reporting & Analytics**: Supports tracking key KPIs (e.g., training completion rate, application success rate).

---

### üìå Importance for Organizational Efficiency

This process improves efficiency by removing manual bottlenecks in employment systems. Employers find candidates faster, job seekers are better prepared through training, and MIS administrators can track all activity. The platform bridges the education-to-employment gap and contributes to national workforce development efforts.


# ‚úÖ Phase III ‚Äì Logical Model Design  
---

## üî¢ 1. Entity-Relationship (ER) Model

| Entity             | Attributes                                                           | Keys                          | Data Types                          |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Job_Seeker**     | seeker_id, name, contact, education, job_level, skills               | PK: seeker_id                 | NUMBER, VARCHAR, VARCHAR             |
| **Training_Program**| program_id, name, description, duration                             | PK: program_id                | NUMBER, VARCHAR                      |
| **Enrollment**     | enrollment_id, seeker_id, program_id, completion_status              | PK: enrollment_id<br>FKs: seeker_id, program_id | NUMBER, VARCHAR, VARCHAR |
| **Employer**       | employer_id, company_name, industry, contact                         | PK: employer_id               | NUMBER, VARCHAR                      |
| **Job_Vacancy**    | job_id, employer_id, job_title, skills_required, status              | PK: job_id<br>FK: employer_id | NUMBER, VARCHAR                      |
| **Job_Application**| application_id, seeker_id, job_id, status                            | PK: application_id<br>FKs: seeker_id, job_id | NUMBER, VARCHAR           |

---

## üîÉ 2. Relationships & Constraints

### Relationships

| From Entity     | To Entity        | Type      | Description                                           |
|------------------|------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Job_Seeker       | Enrollment       | One-to-Many | One seeker can enroll in multiple training programs   |
| Training_Program | Enrollment       | One-to-Many | One program can have many seekers                     |
| Employer         | Job_Vacancy      | One-to-Many | One employer can post multiple job vacancies          |
| Job_Seeker       | Job_Application  | One-to-Many | One seeker can apply for many jobs                    |
| Job_Vacancy      | Job_Application  | One-to-Many | One job can receive many applications                 |

### Constraints

- All IDs are `NOT NULL` and `PRIMARY KEY`
- Foreign Keys enforce relationships
- `Status` fields:
  - `Job_Application.status`: CHECK ('Pending', 'Accepted', 'Rejected')
  - `Job_Vacancy.status`: CHECK ('Open', 'Closed')
- `Completion_Status` in `Enrollment`: CHECK ('Completed', 'Ongoing', 'Not Started')

---

## üì¶ 3. Normalization (Up to 3NF)

| Form | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| **1NF** | No repeating groups, all attributes are atomic |
| **2NF** | No partial dependencies (non-key attributes depend on full PK) |
| **3NF** | No transitive dependencies between non-key attributes |

---

## üåç 4. Handling Real-World Data Scenarios

- Tracks training progress and completion through `Enrollment`.
- Matches seekers to jobs via skill matching logic in `Job_Vacancy` and `Job_Seeker`.
- Logs all job applications and their statuses for employers and administrators.
- Scalable structure to add login, location tracking, or performance metrics in future versions.

---

## üìä 5. ER Diagram Presentation

The logical model is supported by a visual **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** showing:

- Tables (entities)
- Relationships (1:M, M:N)
- Primary and foreign keys

## *Cursors are used implicitly in this section:*

### *üîç Explanation (Implicit Cursor)
Uses FOR rec IN (SELECT...) to implicitly open, fetch, and close the cursor.

Oracle handles cursor lifecycle internally.

rec refers to each row returned.


*üí° If you want to use an explicit cursor, here's how you would rewrite it:*

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE fetch_applications_by_seeker_explicit (
    p_seeker_id IN NUMBER
) AS
    CURSOR app_cursor IS
        SELECT * FROM Job_Application WHERE Seeker_ID = p_seeker_id;
    app_row app_cursor%ROWTYPE;
BEGIN
    OPEN app_cursor;
    LOOP
        FETCH app_cursor INTO app_row;
        EXIT WHEN app_cursor%NOTFOUND;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Application: ' || app_row.Application_ID || ', Status: ' || app_row.Status);
    END LOOP;
    CLOSE app_cursor;
EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Error: ' || SQLERRM);
END;
```




### ‚ôªÔ∏è *Function to Get Total Transaction Amount* 

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_total_applications (
    p_seeker_id IN NUMBER
) RETURN NUMBER IS
    total NUMBER := 0;
BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO total FROM Job_Application WHERE Seeker_ID = p_seeker_id;
    RETURN total;
EXCEPTION
    WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND THEN RETURN 0;
    WHEN OTHERS THEN RETURN -1;
END;
```

###üåÄPhase VII


## üóÇ 1. Problem Statement Development

### üîπ Problem Statement  

In the **Work Seeker Platform**, it is essential to **protect sensitive job application data** by enforcing secure access policies and enabling full auditing. To ensure integrity and accountability, the system must:

- Prevent unauthorized users (e.g., employees) from making changes during restricted periods (weekdays or public holidays).
- Track every critical modification (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) performed on sensitive tables like `Job_Application` or `Job_Vacancy`.
- Automatically log all operations to support security audits and system monitoring.

---


### üîπ Justification  

- **Triggers**: Restrict DML actions on specific days (e.g., weekdays & holidays).
- **Packages & Functions**: Modular and reusable logic to check for restricted periods and store audit logs.
- **Audit Tables**: Ensure traceability of all operations for compliance and fraud detection.

---
## üì† 2. Trigger Implementation  

### üîπ Step 1: Holiday Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE holidays (
    holiday_date DATE PRIMARY KEY,
    description VARCHAR2(100)
);

-- Sample holidays
INSERT INTO holidays VALUES (TO_DATE('2025-06-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 'Job Market Fair');
INSERT INTO holidays VALUES (TO_DATE('2025-06-25', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 'National Career Day');
COMMIT;
```
üîπ Step 2: Restriction Trigger
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trg_block_weekday_and_holiday_dml
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON Job_Application
FOR EACH ROW
DECLARE
    v_day VARCHAR2(10);
    v_today DATE := TRUNC(SYSDATE);
    v_count INTEGER;
BEGIN
    SELECT TO_CHAR(v_today, 'DY', 'NLS_DATE_LANGUAGE=ENGLISH') INTO v_day FROM dual;
    
    IF v_day IN ('MON', 'TUE', 'WED', 'THU', 'FRI') THEN
        RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20001, 'Job application DML is blocked on weekdays.');
    END IF;

    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO v_count
    FROM holidays
    WHERE holiday_date = v_today;

    IF v_count > 0 THEN
        RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20002, 'DML blocked on public holidays.');
    END IF;
END;
```

üßø 3. Auditing with Triggers

üîπ Step 1: Audit Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE audit_log (
    log_id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    action_type VARCHAR2(10),
    table_name VARCHAR2(50),
    user_name VARCHAR2(50),
    action_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT SYSTIMESTAMP,
    old_data CLOB,
    new_data CLOB
);
```

üîπ Step 2: Simple Row-Level Audit Trigger

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trg_audit_job_applications
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON Job_Application
FOR EACH ROW
DECLARE
    v_old_data CLOB := NULL;
    v_new_data CLOB := NULL;
BEGIN
    IF INSERTING THEN
        v_new_data := 'Seeker ID: ' || :NEW.Seeker_ID || ', Job ID: ' || :NEW.Job_ID || ', Status: ' || :NEW.Status;
        INSERT INTO audit_log (action_type, table_name, user_name, new_data)
        VALUES ('INSERT', 'Job_Application', USER, v_new_data);
        
    ELSIF UPDATING THEN
        v_old_data := 'Seeker ID: ' || :OLD.Seeker_ID || ', Job ID: ' || :OLD.Job_ID || ', Status: ' || :OLD.Status;
        v_new_data := 'Seeker ID: ' || :NEW.Seeker_ID || ', Job ID: ' || :NEW.Job_ID || ', Status: ' || :NEW.Status;
        INSERT INTO audit_log (action_type, table_name, user_name, old_data, new_data)
        VALUES ('UPDATE', 'Job_Application', USER, v_old_data, v_new_data);
        
    ELSIF DELETING THEN
        v_old_data := 'Seeker ID: ' || :OLD.Seeker_ID || ', Job ID: ' || :OLD.Job_ID || ', Status: ' || :OLD.Status;
        INSERT INTO audit_log (action_type, table_name, user_name, old_data)
        VALUES ('DELETE', 'Job_Application', USER, v_old_data);
    END IF;
END;
```

üî® 4. Optional: Compound Trigger for Bulk Changes

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trg_audit_bulk_job_applications
FOR INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON Job_Application
COMPOUND TRIGGER

    TYPE t_log_record IS RECORD (
        action_type VARCHAR2(10),
        table_name  VARCHAR2(50),
        user_name   VARCHAR2(50),
        old_data    CLOB,
        new_data    CLOB
    );

    TYPE t_log_table IS TABLE OF t_log_record INDEX BY PLS_INTEGER;
    v_logs t_log_table;
    v_index PLS_INTEGER := 0;

AFTER EACH ROW IS
BEGIN
    v_index := v_index + 1;

    IF INSERTING THEN
        v_logs(v_index).action_type := 'INSERT';
        v_logs(v_index).new_data := 'Job ID: ' || :NEW.Job_ID || ', Status: ' || :NEW.Status;
    ELSIF UPDATING THEN
        v_logs(v_index).action_type := 'UPDATE';
        v_logs(v_index).old_data := 'Job ID: ' || :OLD.Job_ID || ', Status: ' || :OLD.Status;
        v_logs(v_index).new_data := 'Job ID: ' || :NEW.Job_ID || ', Status: ' || :NEW.Status;
    ELSIF DELETING THEN
        v_logs(v_index).action_type := 'DELETE';
        v_logs(v_index).old_data := 'Job ID: ' || :OLD.Job_ID || ', Status: ' || :OLD.Status;
    END IF;

    v_logs(v_index).user_name := USER;
    v_logs(v_index).table_name := 'Job_Application';
END AFTER EACH ROW;

AFTER STATEMENT IS
BEGIN
    FOR i IN 1 .. v_logs.COUNT LOOP
        INSERT INTO audit_log (action_type, table_name, user_name, old_data, new_data)
        VALUES (
            v_logs(i).action_type,
            v_logs(i).table_name,
            v_logs(i).user_name,
            v_logs(i).old_data,
            v_logs(i).new_data
        );
    END LOOP;
END AFTER STATEMENT;

END trg_audit_bulk_job_applications;
```
üì¶ 5. Audit Package (Reusable Logic)

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE audit_pkg AS
    PROCEDURE log_action(
        p_action_type IN VARCHAR2,
        p_table_name IN VARCHAR2,
        p_user_name IN VARCHAR2,
        p_old_data IN CLOB,
        p_new_data IN CLOB
    );
END audit_pkg;
/

CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY audit_pkg AS
    PROCEDURE log_action(
        p_action_type IN VARCHAR2,
        p_table_name IN VARCHAR2,
        p_user_name IN VARCHAR2,
        p_old_data IN CLOB,
        p_new_data IN CLOB
    ) IS
    BEGIN
        INSERT INTO audit_log (
            action_type, table_name, user_name, old_data, new_data
        ) VALUES (
            p_action_type, p_table_name, p_user_name, p_old_data, p_new_data
        );
    END log_action;
END audit_pkg;
```
üì© Conclusion of Phase VII
The Work Seeker Platform now includes built-in security and audit mechanisms to prevent unauthorized or suspicious changes to job application data. Using PL/SQL triggers, compound triggers, and packages, the system can:

Restrict updates during business days or national holidays

Track every modification for legal and operational review

Ensure integrity and compliance with institutional policies

These improvements offer a solid foundation for scalable, auditable, and secure job matching operations.
